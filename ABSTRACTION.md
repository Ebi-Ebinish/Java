An **abstract method**:
    
    - has **no body** (only declaration).
        
    - ends with a semicolon `;`.
        
    - must be implemented by subclasses .
        
- If a class has **at least one abstract method**, the class itself must be declared as **abstract**.
    
Abstract classes can have:
    
    - abstract methods (no body)
        
    - concrete methods (with body)
        
    - fields (variables)
        
    - constructors (yes, abstract classes can have constructors)
