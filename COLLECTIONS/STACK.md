### **What is stack?**

          Stack is subclass of vector. It has dynamic array. It stores the element LIFO (Last in First Out).

It inherit all the methods from vector and also it has its own methods also.

A stack is Linear Data Structure.

It’s a part of collection framework java.util package.

It adds **LIFO-specific methods** like `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `empty()`, and `search().`

Elements are stored **in contiguous memory** (array).

Each time you push(), it adds an element to the **end** of the internal array.

pop() simply removes the **last element** of that array.
