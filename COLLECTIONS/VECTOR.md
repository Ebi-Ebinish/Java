## What is vector?

- The vector is from collection framework.  
- The vector is same like array list dynamic array to store an element.  
- When the vector gets full it’s automatically resize with 2* the capacity.  
- All the elements store in continuous memory location.  
- It’s synchronized and its thread safe.  
- Vector is implemented from List interface.  
- It’s one of the oldest collection classes (introduced in JDK 1.0, before the Collection Framework).

## What is synchronized?

In Java, synchronized means only one thread at a time can access a shared resource (like a method, block, or object).  

It is used to prevent data inconsistency or race conditions when multiple threads access and modify the same data simultaneously.  

When a method or block is marked as synchronized, Java uses a lock (monitor) on the object or class.  

- Only one thread can hold the lock at a time.  
- Other threads must wait until the lock is released.  

So it ensures thread-safe access to shared data.

- The vector has a subclass of Stack.  
- The stack inherit all the methods of the Vector and stack also has the own methods.
