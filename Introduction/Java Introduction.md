1. Java is a **high level [[PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE]] — means human readable.

2. [Platform Independent](PROGRAMMING%20LANGUAGE#What%20is%20Platform%20Independence?) — it means we can run the `.class` file and execute it on any OS, like Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, etc.  
   This flow is called **WORA → Write Once, Run Anywhere**, which is achieved through the JVM.

3. Java is an **Object Oriented Programming** language — that means code can be reused anywhere using the **object**, which is a blueprint of a **class**.


[[INSIDE JDK FUNCTIONALITY’S]]

**Flow:**  
`Java File (.java)` → **[javac]** → `ByteCode File (.class)` → **[JVM / Java Interpreter]** → **Running it** (by first converting it into binary code specific to the machine)

Bytecode and binary code are not the same, although they are related and both are represented using binary digits (0s and 1s).

## Bytecode

### Definition:
An **intermediate code** generated by the Java compiler (`javac`).

- Stored in `.class` files
- **Target:** Java Virtual Machine (JVM), **not the CPU directly**
- Portable across platforms → the same bytecode runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, etc. (because JVM handles the translation)

---

## Binary Code (Machine Code)

### Definition:
The **final low-level instructions** (made of `0`s and `1`s) that the **CPU executes**.

- Generated by JVM’s **JIT compiler** (or interpreter) at runtime from bytecode
- **Target:** Specific CPU architecture (x86, ARM, RISC-V, etc.)
- **Not portable** → binary for x86 won’t run on ARM

---

### Summary:

- **Bytecode** = Platform-independent code for the **JVM**
- **Binary code** = Platform-dependent machine code for the **CPU**
