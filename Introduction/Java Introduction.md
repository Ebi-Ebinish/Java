1.     Java is a **high level programming language** means human readable.

2.     **Platform independent** it means we can run or execute this any OS, like Windows, Linux, macOS, Android etc. This flow called **WORA → Write Once, Run Anywhere**. That archived through JVM

3.     Java is **Object Oriented programming** language that means reusable the code at anywhere.p

**Flow of JDK with java file:**[[Welcome]]

Java File (.java) -> [javac] -> ByteCode File (.class) -> [JVM/Java Interpreter] -> Running it(by first converting it into binary code specific to the machine)

Bytecode and binary code are not the same, although they are related and both are represented using binary digits (0s and 1s).

**Bytecode**

### **Definition:** An **intermediate code** generated by the Java compiler (javac).

Stored in .class files.

**Target:** Java Virtual Machine (JVM), **not the CPU directly**.

Portable across platforms → the same bytecode runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, etc. (because JVM handles the translation).

## Binary Code (Machine Code)

**Definition:** The **final low-level instructions** (made of `0`s and `1`s) that the CPU executes.

Generated by JVM’s **JIT compiler** (or interpreter) at runtime from bytecode.

**Target:** Specific CPU architecture (x86, ARM, RISC-V, etc.).

Not portable → binary for x86 won’t run on ARM.

 **Bytecode** = platform-independent code for the JVM.

 **Binary code** = platform-dependent machine code for the CPU.
