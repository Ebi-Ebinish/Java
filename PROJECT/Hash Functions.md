# What Is a Hash Function?

A mathematical function that converts any input into a fixed-length output.

It is **NOT encryption**.

Very important:  
❌ You cannot decrypt a hash  
❌ There is no key

It is **one-way only**.

The input change slightly means the output will completely different, Even it will change for the capital and the small characters also.
## Example:

Password 
# Types 

1. MD5
2. SHA 1
3. SHA 256
4. SHA 512
### 1. Fixed Length

No matter input size:

- 5 letters
- 1000 pages
- 10GB file
