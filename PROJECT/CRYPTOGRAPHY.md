# CRYPTOGRAPHY
###### Imagine I am sending a letter to Lawrence with normal white paper without any secure box or something  just only the paper alone, now that paper while going to Lawrence in between the sender or that postman or the staff anyone can read that paper and anyone can change content in that paper not secure right.
###### now your sending that same paper with some some boxed with the locked that box has only two keys one  in your hand and another one is your Lawrence has.
###### now in between no one can read or change that content your data's is secure.

# So What Is Cryptography?

The word "cryptography" comes from Greek roots meaning "hidden writing."

Cryptography is:

> The science of protecting information by converting it into a secret form so only authorized people can read it.

Simple definition:  
It turns **readable data → unreadable data**.
# What is ciphertext

Ciphertext Is encrypted unreadable data generated by converting plaintext using an algorithm known as a cipher.
# Why Cryptography is needed 

In the real usage assume that your logging a bank website for changing some details.
that request works with internet ---> routers ---> server.
example:
```
{
	"Username":"test",
	"Password":"test@123"
}
```
If without cryptography means that details will go same readable format that means the hacker read your data and change your data while the request processing to server.

#### When you Cryptography:

- Log in to a website
- Use internet banking
- Send WhatsApp messages
- Pay using UPI
- Enter your ATM PIN

#### Your data travels through:

	Internet → routers → servers → multiple systems

#### Without protection:

- Hackers can read passwords
- Bank data can be stolen
- Messages can be modified

So we need cryptography.

# What Problems Does Cryptography Solve?

Cryptography solves 4 main problems:

---
## 1️⃣ Confidentiality (Privacy)

Ensures:  
Only intended person can read the data.

Example:  
Your password should not be readable by hackers.

---
## 2️⃣ Integrity (No Modification)

Ensures:  
Data is not changed during transmission.

Example:  
If you transfer ₹10,000  
It should not become ₹100,000.

---
## 3️⃣ Authentication (Identity Verification)

Ensures:  
You are really talking to the correct person/system.

Example:  
When you open a bank website,  
You must be sure it is the real bank, not fake.

---
## 4️⃣ Non-Repudiation (No Denial)

Ensures:  
Sender cannot deny sending the message.

Used in:

- Digital signatures
- Online contracts

#### Process:
- Encryption → Plaintext → Ciphertext
- Decryption → Ciphertext → Plaintext

# Main Types of Cryptography

There are **4 major categories**:

1️⃣ Symmetric Key Cryptography  
2️⃣ Asymmetric Key Cryptography  
3️⃣ Hash Functions  
4️⃣ Digital Signatures

# Symmetric Cryptography 

Symmetric cryptography means the key used both encryption and decryption.
### Example

If your sending an ATM pin 4589.
ATM does NOT send `4589` to bank.
ATM encrypts it using a **symmetric key** stored inside secure hardware (HSM).
Bank uses the **same secret key** to decrypt and verify.
### 📦 Example:

You and your friend share a secret password:

`Key = 12345`

You encrypt message using 12345  
Your friend decrypts using 12345

If someone gets the key → security broken.

---
### ✅ Characteristics:

- Very fast
- Good for large data
- Used in bulk encryption

### 🔐 Examples:

- AES (modern standard)
- 3DES (old)
- DES (obsolete)
---
### 🏦 Where Used:

- HTTPS session encryption
- Disk encryption
- ATM PIN encryption
- Database encryption

---
### ⚠ Problem:

How do you securely share the key?

That problem is solved by asymmetric cryptography.

Same key used on both sides → That is symmetric cryptography.

---
# Asymmetric Key Cryptography

Also called **Public Key Cryptography**

### 🔑 Concept:

Two different keys:

- Public Key (shared with everyone)
- Private Key (kept secret)

What one key encrypts, the other decrypts.

---

### 📦 Example:

Bank has:
- Public key (anyone can see)
- Private key (only bank knows)

You:

- Encrypt message using bank’s public key
- Only bank can decrypt using private key

Even if hacker sees public key → cannot decrypt.

---
### ✅ Characteristics:

- More secure key exchange
- Slower than symmetric
- Used for authentication & key exchange

---
### 🔐 Examples:

- RSA
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Diffie-Hellman

---
### 🌐 Used In:

- SSL/TLS
- Digital certificates
- Secure login
- Key exchange

# What does an HSM store?

- **Cryptographic Keys:** HSMs store master keys, root CA keys, symmetric keys (AES), and private keys for asymmetric cryptography (RSA/ECC).
- **Encrypted Keys:** When keys are stored on the HSM, they are protected by a "Local Master Key" (LMK) within the hardened boundary, meaning they are never exposed in plaintext.


#  What Makes Encryption Work?

Encryption needs something called a **Key**.

#### Think of a key like:

- A password
- A secret number
- A secret formula

#### Without the correct key:  
	You cannot convert ciphertext back to plaintext.

#### The security depends on:

- Strength of algorithm
- Length of key
- How safely key is stored
